# Gold Price Prediction Using Random Forest Regressor
This project uses the Random Forest Regressor to predict the price of gold based on market-related features. The dataset contains historical data of gold prices and other financial indicators, and the target column represents the gold price (GLD).

## What the code does
* Loads the Gold Price dataset
* Shows basic information about the data
* Checks missing values
* Analyzes correlation between features
* Splits the data into training and testing sets
* Trains a Random Forest Regressor model
* Calculates R² accuracy on test data
* Visualizes Actual vs Predicted gold prices

## Steps in the project
1. Import required libraries
2. Load the dataset
3. Inspect the first and last few rows
4. Check dataset size and info
5. Check for missing values
6. Analyze statistical measures of data
7. Plot correlation heatmap
8. Visualize distribution of gold prices
9. Separate features and target
10. Split data into training and test sets
11. Train Random Forest Regressor model
12. Evaluate accuracy using R² score
13. Compare actual vs predicted gold prices in a plot

## Result
* R² score on test data
* Plot comparing actual and predicted gold prices

## How to run
* Make sure the dataset file is available
* Install required libraries (e.g, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)
* Run the script in your Python or Google Colab environment

# Diabetes Prediction Using Support Vector Machine
This project uses Support Vector Machine (SVM) to predict whether a person has diabetes or not.
The dataset contains health-related measurements for each individual, and the last column shows the label (0 → Non-Diabetic, 1 → Diabetic).

## What the code does
* Loads the PIMA Diabetes dataset
* Shows basic information about the data
* Splits the data into training and testing sets
* Trains an SVM model with a linear kernel
* Checks accuracy on both training and test data
* Predicts whether a new input indicates diabetes

## Steps in the project
* Import required libraries
* Read the dataset
* Separate features and labels
* Standardize the data
* Split data into train and test sets
* Train the SVM model
* Evaluate accuracy
* Test the model with a sample input

## Result
* Accuracy on training data
* Accuracy on test data
* Final prediction for the given input

## How to run
* Make sure the dataset file is available
* Run the script in your environment

# Heart Disease Prediction Using Logistic Regression
This project uses Logistic Regression to predict whether a person has heart disease based on multiple medical features. The dataset contains health-related attributes, and the target column indicates the presence (1) or absence (0) of heart disease.

## What the code does
* Loads the Heart Disease dataset
* Shows first and last rows of the dataset
* Checks dataset size and info
* Checks missing values
* Displays statistical summary
* Checks distribution of the target variable
* Splits the dataset into features and target
* Splits data into training and testing sets
* Trains Logistic Regression model
* Calculates accuracy on training and test data
* Builds a predictive system to classify new input

## Steps in the project
1. Import required libraries
2. Load the dataset
3. View first 5 rows
4. View last 5 rows
5. Check dataset size
6. Check dataset info
7. Check missing values
8. Show statistical summary
9. Analyze target distribution
10. Split features and target
11. Split data into train and test sets
12. Train Logistic Regression model
13. Evaluate accuracy
14. Build predictive system for new inputs

## Result
* Accuracy score on training data
* Accuracy score on test data
* Predictive system output showing whether the person has heart disease or not

## How to run
* Make sure the dataset file is available
* Install required libraries (e.g, numpy, pandas, scikit-learn)
* Run the script in Python / Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

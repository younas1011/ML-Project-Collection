# Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Logistic Regression
This project uses Logistic Regression to detect fraudulent credit card transactions based on various numerical features. The dataset contains transaction-related attributes, and the target column indicates whether a transaction is fraudulent (1) or legitimate (0).

## What the code does
* Loads the Credit Card Fraud dataset
* Shows first and last rows of the dataset
* Checks dataset size and info
* Checks missing values
* Displays statistical summary
* Checks distribution of the target variable
* Handles class imbalance using undersampling
* Splits the dataset into features and target
* Splits data into training and testing sets
* Trains Logistic Regression model
* Calculates accuracy on training and test data
* Builds a predictive system to classify new transactions

## Steps in the project
1. Load the dataset
2. View first 5 rows
3. View last 5 rows
4. Check dataset size
5. Check dataset info
6. Check missing values
7. Show statistical summary
8. Analyze target distribution
9. Apply undersampling to balance the dataset
10. Split features and target
11. Split data into train and test sets
12. Train Logistic Regression model
13. Evaluate accuracy
14. Build predictive system for new inputs

## Result
* Accuracy score on training data
* Accuracy score on test data
* Predictive system output showing whether the transaction is fraudulent (1) or legitimate (0)

## How to run
* Make sure the dataset file is available
* Install required libraries(e.g, numpy, pandas, scikit-learn)
* Run the script in Python / Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

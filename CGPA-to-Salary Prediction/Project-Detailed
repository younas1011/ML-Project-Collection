# CGPA and Salary Prediction Project

This project uses a linear regression model to predict salary packages based on students' CGPA using a dataset of student placements.

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: Predict the salary packages of students based on their CGPA using linear regression.
- **Tools Used**: Python, pandas, scikit-learn.

## Project Steps

### Data Collection
- **Dataset**: The project uses `placement.csv`, which includes data on students' CGPA and their salary packages after graduation.

### Data Preparation
- **Loading Data**: We load the dataset using pandas.
- **Features and Target**: The feature is CGPA (`X`), and the target variable is the salary package (`y`).

### Data Splitting
- **Train-Test Split**: The data is split into training and testing sets with an 80-20 ratio using `train_test_split`.
  - `X_train`, `X_test`: Training and testing data for features.
  - `y_train`, `y_test`: Training and testing data for the target variable.

### Model Training
- **Model Selection**: We use a `LinearRegression` model.
- **Training**: The model is trained on `X_train` and `y_train`.

### Model Prediction
- **Predictions**: The model predicts salary packages for the test set `X_test`.

### Model Evaluation
- **Metrics**:
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures the average squared errors.
  - **R-squared**: Indicates how well the model fits the data.
- **Results**: The MSE, R-squared value, model intercept, and coefficient are printed.

### Results Visualization
- **Comparison**: A DataFrame compares actual vs. predicted salary values.

## Instructions for Running

1. **Clone the Repository**: Download the project files.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have Python 3.x and required libraries.
3. **Prepare Dataset**: Place `placement.csv` in the project directory.
4. **Execute the Script**:

   ```bash
   python cgpa_salary_prediction.py

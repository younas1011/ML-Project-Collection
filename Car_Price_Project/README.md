# Car Price Prediction Using Linear Regression & Lasso Regression
This project uses Linear Regression and Lasso Regression to predict the selling price of used cars. The dataset contains various car-related features, and the target column represents the selling price of the car.

## What the code does
* Loads the Car Price dataset
* Shows basic information about the data
* Checks missing values
* Encodes categorical columns into numerical values
* Splits the data into training and testing sets
* Trains Linear Regression and Lasso Regression models
* Calculates R² accuracy on both training and test data
* Visualizes Actual vs Predicted prices

## Steps in the project
1. Import required libraries
2. Load the dataset
3. Inspect the first few rows
4. Check dataset size and info
5. Check for missing values
6. Analyze categorical data distribution
7. Encode categorical columns
8. Separate features and labels
9. Split data into train and test sets
10. Train Linear Regression model
11. Evaluate accuracy
12. Visualize results
13. Train Lasso Regression model
14. Evaluate accuracy
15. Visualize results

## Result
* R² score on training data
* R² score on test data
* Scatter plots comparing actual and predicted prices

## How to run
* Make sure the dataset file is available
* Install required libraries (e.g, numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn)
* Run the script in your Python or Google Colab environment

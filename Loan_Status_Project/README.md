# Loan Approval Prediction Using Support Vector Machine
This project uses Support Vector Machine (SVM) to predict whether a loan application will be approved or not. The dataset contains different applicant and loan-related features, and the last column shows the label (0 → Not Approved, 1 → Approved).

## What the code does
* Loads the Loan Approval dataset
* Shows basic information about the data
* Handles missing values
* Converts categorical data into numerical form
* Splits the data into training and testing sets
* Trains an SVM model with a linear kernel
* Checks accuracy on both training and test data
* Predicts whether a new input will be approved or not

## Steps in the project
1. Import required libraries
2. Load the dataset
3. Check the first few rows
4. Handle missing values
5. Encode categorical columns
6. Separate features and labels
7. Split data into train and test sets
8. Train the SVM model
9. Evaluate accuracy
11. Test the model with a sample input

## Result
* Accuracy on training data
* Accuracy on test data
* Final prediction for the given input

## How to run
* Make sure the dataset file is available
* Install required libraries (e.g, numpy, pandas, seaborn, scikit-learn)
* Run the script in your environment

# Insurance Cost Prediction Using Linear Regression
This project uses Linear Regression to predict medical insurance charges based on customer information such as age, gender, BMI, children, smoking status, and region. The dataset contains both numerical and categorical features, and the target column represents the insurance cost.

## What the code does
* Loads the Insurance dataset
* Shows first and last rows of the dataset
* Checks dataset size and info
* Identifies categorical features
* Checks for missing values
* Displays statistical summary
* Visualizes distributions of important features
* Encodes categorical columns into numerical values
* Splits the dataset into features and target
* Splits data into training and testing sets
* Trains a Linear Regression model
* Calculates R² accuracy on both training and test data
* Builds a predictive system to estimate insurance charges

## Steps in the project
1. Import required libraries
2. Load the dataset
3. View first 5 rows
4. View last 5 rows
5. Check dataset size
6. Check dataset info
7. Identify categorical features
8. Check for missing values
9. Show statistical summary
10. Analyze feature distributions (age, sex, bmi, smokers, region, charges)
11. Encode categorical columns
12. Split features and target
13. Split data into train and test sets
14. Train Linear Regression model
15. Evaluate accuracy using R² score
16. Build predictive system for new inputs

## Result
* R² score on training data
* R² score on test data
* Predictive system output showing the estimated insurance cost

## How to run
* Make sure the dataset file is available
* Install required libraries (numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn)
* Run the script in Python / Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
